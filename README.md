# Neighborhood Map Project READ ME

Hi,  welcome to my Neighborhood Map application.  My neighborhood map features my home town, the Town Of Jean Lafitte.  This application utilizes the Google Maps and Foursquare API's to obtain data about things to do in and around the town.  See below for further information about this application.

## Running The Application

To run the application, simply visit https://bjm2020.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-Neighborhood-Map/.

## Foursquare data

All locations are retrieved at the start of the application from the FourSquare developers API.

## Google Maps

Google maps is used to display the retrieved locations on a map canvas.

## Filtering and Other functions

The application features a collapsible side menu that has the following functions:

### Filtering

Click on the Menu's dropdown list to filter location's based on category.

### Infowindow information

Click on a list item or a Map Marker to pop up an window with more information about
each location.  This displays information retrived from the FourSquare API such as
a picture of the location, address, FourSquare rating, and recent comments by other Foursquare users.
